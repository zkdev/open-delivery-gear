# Reacting upon OCM events

## Purpose

The artefact-enumerator extension periodically checks the configured
[OCM artefacts](#ocm-components) and available
[runtime artefacts](#runtime-artefacts) and takes care of the lifecycle of
their [compliance snapshots](#compliance-snapshots)
(create/update/delete). Based on the status information in the compliance
snapshots, the artefact-enumerator evaluates whether it must create backlog
items for certain extensions or not.

## How it works

(artefacts)=
### Artefacts

It is required to specify a set of **artefacts "of interest"** which should be
periodically being processed by the available extensions (e.g. scanned,
reported, etc.). Apart from these periodical triggers initiated by the
artefact-enumerator, certain extensions might be triggered manually by creating
a respective **backlog item** for the desired extension and `artefact` (see
[example](#example-backlog-item)), for example via delivery-dashboard or
directly via ODG API or cluster API. In general, creating backlog
items is the same trigger as used by the artefact-enumerator, however, certain
extensions might require the artefacts to be configured here in order to
process them (e.g.
{doc}`issue-replicator extension </contents/concepts/03-issue-replicator>`). Artefacts
may be configured in two different ways, as referenced
[OCM components](#ocm-components) or as
[runtime artefacts](#runtime-artefacts).

(ocm-components)=
#### OCM Components

OCM components are configured using the `components` property in the extensions
configuration. The configured components and their dependencies are retrieved
**recursively** and each of their dependencies is subject of being processed.
As the Open Delivery Gear generally works on the granularity of
`ComponentArtefactIds`, each `resource` and `source` of the OCM components is
parsed into such a `ComponentArtefactId` and tracked individually.

(runtime-artefacts)=
#### Runtime Artefacts

To be also able to process artefacts which are not (yet) subject of being
modelled via OCM, i.e. volatile **runtime artefacts**, those can be added to
the list of artefacts "of interest" by creating respective `RuntimeArtefact`
custom resources, either via ODG API or via cluster API (see
[example](#example-runtime-artefact)). Note that, because these artefacts
are not modelled via OCM, the artefact-enumerator is not able to resolve any
dependencies and thus each artefact must be specified via a dedicated runtime
artefact. Those runtime artefacts also contain a `ComponentArtefactId` and are
later processed equally as the before mentioned OCM resources and sources.

(compliance-snapshots)=
### Compliance Snapshots

Compliance snapshots are used as internal state for the configured
[artefacts](#artefacts), e.g. to store information on the last execution
time by an extension or to keep track of artefacts which should be reported
before but, by now, they are not "of interest" anymore, and thus, for example,
remaining open GitHub issues must be closed. Therefore, for each artefact, a
respective compliance snapshot is being created. Already existing compliance
snapshots of artefacts which are not "of interest" anymore are kept for an
extra grace period to allow other extensions (e.g. the
{doc}`issue-replicator </contents/concepts/03-issue-replicator>`) to react upon those
changes (e.g. to close related GitHub issues).

## Examples

### Configuration

```yaml
artefact_enumerator:
  components:
    - component_name: example.org/my-component
      ocm_repo_url: europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases
      version: greatest
      max_versions_limit: 1
```

(example-backlog-item)=
### Backlog Item

```yaml
apiVersion: delivery-gear.gardener.cloud/v1
kind: BacklogItem
metadata:
  name: issuereplicator-8-abcde
  namespace: delivery
  labels:
    delivery-gear.gardener.cloud/service: issueReplicator
spec:
  artefact:
    component_name: example.org/my-component
    component_version: 0.1.0
    artefact_kind: runtime
    artefact:
      artefact_name: my-runtime-resource
      artefact_version: 0.1.0
      artefact_type: virtual-machine
      artefact_extra_id:
        version: 0.1.0
        hyperscaler: my-hyperscaler
  priority: 8
  timestamp: '2025-01-01T12:00:00.000000+00:00'
```

(example-runtime-artefact)=
### Runtime Artefact

```yaml
apiVersion: delivery-gear.gardener.cloud/v1
kind: RuntimeArtefact
metadata:
  name: runtime-artefact-abcde
  namespace: delivery
spec:
  artefact:
    component_name: example.org/my-component
    component_version: 0.1.0
    artefact_kind: runtime
    artefact:
      artefact_name: my-runtime-resource
      artefact_version: 0.1.0
      artefact_type: virtual-machine
      artefact_extra_id:
        version: 0.1.0
        hyperscaler: my-hyperscaler
  creation_date: '2025-01-01T12:00:00.000000+00:00'
```
