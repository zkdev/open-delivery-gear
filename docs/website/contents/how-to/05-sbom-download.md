# Download SBOM Documents

The SBOM-Generator extension generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
documents for the OCM resources of your components. It uses
[Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to scan artefacts directly,
and stores the generated SBOMs in the ODG blob storage. SBOMs can
be downloaded from the ODG Dashboard or via API.

## Prerequisites

- Your product must be added to the ODG Dashboard
- SBOM-Generator extension must be enabled in your ODG instance

## Download SBOM for Your Product

1. Open your product page in the ODG Dashboard.

2. Click the **DOWNLOAD SBOM** button.

   ![Download SBOM button](/res/download-sbom-button.svg)

   This opens the SBOM popover, where all sub-components are grouped into two
   sections: **Ready** and **Not ready**.

   The popover also shows the configured output format, and displays the access
   type and artefact type for each sub-component.

   ```{hint}
   The popover updates in real time. No manual refresh is needed.
   ```

## Download SBOM for a Sub-Component

To download the SBOM for a specific sub-component:

1. Open the sub-component page in the ODG Dashboard
2. Click the **DOWNLOAD SBOM** button

## Manually Trigger SBOM Generation

If a component's SBOM has not been generated yet:

1. Open the **DOWNLOAD SBOM** popover for your component
2. Check the **Not ready** section for pending sub-components
3. Click the **Trigger SBOM generation** button when available

This schedules SBOM generation for all pending sub-components immediately. The
popover updates in real time, and completed SBOMs move from **Not ready** to
**Ready** as they finish.
