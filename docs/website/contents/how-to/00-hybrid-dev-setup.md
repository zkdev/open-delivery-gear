# Setting up a hybrid dev setup

## Goal

Run ODG code (e.g. to test a new extension) locally and connecting it to a running ODG instance.

## You will end up with

An environment, capable of running ODG code (packages, libraries, ...) connected to a running ODG instance. The locally running code can focus on the payload.

## Prerequisites

- An ODG instance and a kubeconfig (using static credentials)
- `python3`, `pip3`
- GitHub Token authorised to access ODG API

## Actions

### Preparation

Pull the [ODG Core repository](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core).
Install dependencies using `pip3`.

```
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Hint**: if you are not using virtual environments, you have to additionally provide the `--break-system-packages` flag

### Configuration and Secrets


Configuration and Secrets are expected to be available via local file paths.
In a Kubernetes environment, this is implemented using mounted ConfigMaps and Secrets.
On a local machine these files are created manually.

#### Configuration

The [ODG Core repository](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core) features blueprints and default configuration files already.
They can just be adjusted, as ODG will use them by default.

- [Configuring your Extensions](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core/blob/master/odg/extensions_cfg.yaml)
- [Configuring your supported Findings](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core/blob/master/odg/findings_cfg.yaml)

An in-depth documentation for all the available configuration options is [here](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core/blob/master/charts/bootstrapping/values.documentation.yaml).

#### Secrets

ODG features a typed Secret system. There is an opinion on how a secret has to be structured and named.
The [secrets directory](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core/tree/master/secrets) features templates for supported secret types. To make them effective, the `.template` string has to be dropped from the filename.

Also for the secret structure and semantics, [there is detailed documentation](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core/blob/c8b4f4fe055b8719a0dd849026678f6ab8127d76/charts/bootstrapping/values.documentation.yaml#L1558).

### Connecting with an ODG instance

ODG code connects in two ways with a running instance: on Kubernetes level and with ODG-API.

#### Kubernetes

To connect ODG code to a running cluster, you need to obtain a valid `kubeconfig` (with static credentials) and put it into a local file.
ODG will pick it up when referencing via `--kubeconfig` parameter on startup.

```
python3 -m my-odg-extension --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig
```

#### ODG API

Depending on the GitHub instances the ODG API supports, create a GitHub secret in the ODG secret structure.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > /path/to/odg-api/secrets/github/odg-api.yaml
api_url: https://api.github.com
http_url: https://github.com
username: <your-username>
auth_token: <your-github-token>
repo_urls: []
EOF
```

On ODG code startup, provide the URL to the ODG API with `--delivery-service-url` parameter.

```
python3 -m my-odg-extension --delivery-service-url 'https://delivery-service.demo.ci.gardener.cloud'
```

### Ensure Code Quality

The [ODG Core repository](https://github.com/open-component-model/odg-core) features linters, formatters, and tests. There are callbacks to run them properly configured.

```bash
.ci/lint
.ci/check-format
.ci/test
```
