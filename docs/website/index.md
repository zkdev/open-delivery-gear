# Open Delivery Gear

**Compliance is not living next to software. Instead, it is an integral part of it.**

Open Delivery Gear (ODG) integrates compliance into the software lifecycle through automated scanning, tracking, and reporting of security findings, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues for your OCM components.

## What is ODG?

Open Delivery Gear is a comprehensive compliance automation platform that:

- **Scans OCM components** for vulnerabilities, license compliance, and security issues
- **Tracks findings** throughout the component lifecycle with configurable processing times
- **Replicates issues** to GitHub for visibility and workflow integration
- **Generates SBOMs** (Software Bill of Materials) for transparency and compliance
- **Manages responsibles** by automatically assigning findings to the right teams
